# Machine Learning Course Labs

Welcome to the repository for the labs of the Machine Learning course! In this course, we will explore various machine learning algorithms and concepts, and each lab will cover a specific topic.

## Lab 1: Multi-Linear Regression
In this lab, we explored the fundamentals of multi-linear regression. We learned how to build a predictive model using multiple features to make predictions. The lab covered the following topics:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature selection and engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Visualizing results

You can find the code and documentation for Lab 1 in the directory [Lab1].
